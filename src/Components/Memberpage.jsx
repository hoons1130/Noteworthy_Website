A few years ago, I was driving alone on the highway at cruising speed. The road was straight and the sun was hot, and the moment felt right to sing my heart out. Car singing is way more fun than shower singing because in the car, I really let loose. So I was reaching the climax of a favorite Broadway showstopper, belting with all my heart, when I glanced out my right window. There was a car driving alongside me, and inside was a woman staring at me with an expression that said, “Does he think the car is soundproof?” We locked eyes, sharing the moment when I realized that she was watching me not realize that she heard me. We both looked away quickly. It was awkward for both of us.

There has to be a moral to this story somehow. Maybe it’s that singing should be emotive without inhibition. Sing for yourself and sing from the heart. Or maybe the moral is that you should never make eye contact with people because if they’re already looking at you it’ll be twice as awkward as not making eye contact. Yeah, I think that’s the moral.`;

Have you ever asked AI to generate an image of a really really good-looking teenage Taiwanese male UC Berkeley student who is also in acappella? Well if you have, then you don't need to read the rest of my bio, because the image you saw was indeed an image of me. Now some of you might argue that there are actually no good-looking individuals on the campus of this school, and every student just has so-called "Berkeley Goggles". I would agree with you... if I didn't look in the mirror every morning. And hey, since you already bothered to come all the way to this website, scroll down to find the most fit-looking young man on this page, and begin reading this bio, I thought I would share a special treat with you. I have decided to finally publish my highly curated highly personalized day-to-day routines to live by in order to look almost as good as me.

1. Be Taiwanese. I recommend looking into RCTA if necessary.
2. Dye your hair. It doesn't have to be the ones on your head.
3. Spend at least 4 hours a day with Ellington. Doing what? That I won't share.`;

It is 5:15 AM as I write this and I genuinely believe my soul has the mandate of heaven. I'm like if the Jimmy Timmy Power Hour was a person. I'm like if you averaged every white guy in your local mall between the ages of 16 and 24. I'm like Warren Buffet with Benjamin Button disease. I'm like if the infinite monkeys were trying to write High School Musical 2 instead. I'm Carlton Banks minus the money, plus a gambling addiction.

1. listens to me yap endlessly, most boomer boomer, t1s say they're ugly, one of the biggest scandals in american history
2. absent parent that we all love, the mouse to my cat, eternally sick and busy, lives on a pretty street
3. teddy bear, strong desire for "you", did someone say nice?, day 1 chiller, day 100 lover uwu
4. "where'd [name] go?", direct and blunt, noteworthy’s trailblazer
5. Goat ragecager, most severe case of fomo in nw, quick-witted, “you picked THAT in customs???”
6. blue paper, true day 1, brother that i wish i had, lover that i have, 600 point gap is crazy, sweetheart but rarely shows it

Kian (pronounced like the pepper), a member of the shadowy "mega evil brigade," keeps his true goals shrouded in mystery. While some whisper of world domination, others suspect a more nefarious plot involving...birds? Is Kian a misunderstood environmentalist or a cunning avian overlord? Only time will tell!

In his free time, Kian enjoys a variety of musical genres, including kpop and edm. When not plotting (or protecting the skies from feathered robotic fiends), you can find Kian at the gym, playing cookie run, hanging out with his girlfriend, calling his girlfriend, or sleeping. One thing is certain: Kian's presence guarantees an element of the unexpected, so keep your eyes peeled and your tinfoil hats handy!

Noteworthy Achievements:

- Successfully infiltrated Noteworthy for two semesters without revealing his true identity
- Maintains an astounding record of mega bopping during vocal rehearsals (or is he using some sort of mind control device?)
- Ranked highest for "bird" government tracking chips collected
- Has a low spice tolerance despite having a name pronounced like a pepper`;

When people find out I’m an English major, they immediately assume I’m an amazing story teller. But I’m so much more than that! An absolute menace during rage cage, a cinnamon roll that would actually kill you, a chronic overthinker/daydreamer, a holy mother, your personal close-reading machine that will illuminate things you didn’t know about yourself (and look pretty doing it).

But now. Let me tell you a little story about myself. I’m Madlen, (not Madeleine, or Madelyn, and definitely not Madlyn). Bet you haven’t seen that spelling before... Why is my name spelled like that, you may wonder? Well, it all started when my mom met my dad, and they fell in love and they had me. It was at this time… after casting a single gaze upon me that they knew…`;
